# Dr. Sarah Johnson - Cardiologist Website

This is a simple responsive website I built for a fictional cardiologist named Dr. Sarah Johnson. It includes basic sections like Home, About, Services, Experience, and Contact.

The goal was to practice clean HTML/CSS structure and add a bit of interactivity with JavaScript (like smooth scrolling, a mobile menu, and scroll animations).
